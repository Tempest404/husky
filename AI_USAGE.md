AI_USAGE.md — How I used AI tools in this exercise

Instructions
- Keep this file short (roughly 0.5–1 page). Bullet points are fine.
- Do not paste secrets, company‑internal or proprietary text into AI tools.
- This exercise runs offline; no external API calls are required.

1) Tools used
- Which tool(s) did you use (ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.) and offline/editor integration if any?

2) Prompt(s)
- Copy the key prompts you used (or summarize if many). Keep only what is necessary to understand the interaction.

3) AI output kept vs. modified
- Briefly describe what you kept as‑is and what you changed before committing.
- Add inline markers `# AI-ASSIST:` in code where the AI influenced your changes.

4) Manual correction or improvement (required)
- Provide at least one concrete example where you corrected or improved the AI’s suggestion.
- Explain why the change was needed (correctness, performance, readability, typing, tests, etc.).

5) Reflection
- What went well? What misled you? What would you try differently next time?
