AI_USAGE.md â€” How I used AI tools in this exercise

1) Tools used
- ChatGPT (web): I used this once to understand the assignment description and some of the internal toolings.

2) Prompt(s)
- Prompt 1 (to ChatGPT): "In Hydrology, what is meant by Reach, Catchment and Conservative tracer?"
- Prompt 2 (to ChatGPT): "What is Poetry (python) and what is it used for?". I then proceeded to follow the official documentation of Poetry on how to set up the configuration.

3) AI output kept vs. modified
- I haven't used it for writing code. My bottleneck was mostly in setting up a plan and thinking about the next refactoring step or brainstorming how to structure the code.

4) Manual correction or improvement (required)
- None

5) Reflection
- Went well: I took around 1 hour to understand the concept of the simulation being performed by the run_all() method. Using ChatGPT helped me on this part.
